better hexa_volume for divergence load:
replace decomposition in tetras by jacobian or base times average height

semicoarsening:
decide using A not just geometry
horizontal semicoarsening for large A(3,3)

horizontal semicoarsening based on dx=dy, make explicit
make sure there is some semicoarsening, horizontal or vertical
